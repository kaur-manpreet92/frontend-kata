1. describe any usability issues you can identify with the current prototype sketch for this application
We can use drag and drop with validations insted of left and right click.
2. Which design decisions do you agree with?
Instead of two dimensional array we can have Object based approach where key will be the stage and value will be list of items.
3. Which do you think can be improved? What other ideas or features would be useful to add? 
We can create different components instead of single component. Example: We can create a component for assembly stage and another component assembly item. We can use ngRx to manage states.
